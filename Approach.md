# SMS Spam Classification Challenge

## Introduction

In this challenge, you need to create a machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.

You should create a function called predict_message that takes a message string as an argument and returns a list. The first element in the list should be a number between zero and one that indicates the likeliness of "ham" (0) or "spam" (1). The second element in the list should be the word "ham" or "spam", depending on which is most likely.

For this challenge, you will use the SMS Spam Collection dataset. The dataset has already been grouped into train data and test data.

The first two cells import the libraries and data.

## Approach to SMS Spam Classification

### 1. Data Preprocessing

1. Load the dataset (train and test data)
2. Explore the data to understand its structure and distribution
3. Clean the text data:
   - Remove punctuation
   - Convert to lowercase
   - Remove numbers and special characters
4. Tokenize the messages
5. Create a vocabulary of unique words
6. Convert messages to sequences of word indices
7. Pad sequences to ensure uniform length

## 2. Model Creation

1. Build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras:
   - Use an embedding layer as the first layer to learn word representations
   - Add one or more LSTM or GRU layers for sequence processing
   - Add dense layers with dropout for regularization
   - Use a final dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

## 3. Model Training

1. Split the data into training and validation sets
2. Separate features (X) and labels (y) for both training and validation sets:
   - X_train: SMS message text (preprocessed and tokenized)
   - y_train: Corresponding labels (0 for ham, 1 for spam)
   - X_val: Validation set SMS message text
   - y_val: Validation set labels
3. Train the model using the preprocessed data:
   - Use X_train and y_train for model fitting
   - Use X_val and y_val for validation during training
4. Monitor validation accuracy to prevent overfitting
5. Adjust hyperparameters as needed (learning rate, batch size, epochs)

## 4. Implement predict_message Function

1. Preprocess the input message using the same steps as the training data
2. Use the trained model to make a prediction
3. Return the probability and corresponding label (ham or spam)

## 5. Evaluation

1. Test the model on the provided test dataset
2. Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
3. Analyze misclassifications to identify areas for improvement

## 6. Potential Improvements

1. Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., CNN, Transformer)
2. Try advanced text preprocessing techniques (e.g., lemmatization, stemming)
3. Use pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec)
4. Implement data augmentation techniques for text data
5. Explore ensemble methods to combine multiple models
